Configuration
=============
The configuration for MAH is handled via the standard Python `ConfigParser <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_ framework, which uses the Microsoft INI file structure.


location
--------
The location of the configuration file can be specified via the environment
variable MAHCONFIG.

Example (for Bourne compatible shells):
::

    export MAHCONFIG=/path/to/config/mah.conf
