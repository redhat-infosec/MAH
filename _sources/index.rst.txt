Mutual Authentication for Humans (MAH)
======================================

This system allows a user to easily verify another user as an employee of
the same organisation. It does this by allowing users to create a shared
secret, a short text string. Access to this system should be allowed via a
the strongest possible authentication mechanism available to an
organisation, for example, RSA 2 factor tokens.
