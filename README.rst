MAH README version 1.0.1

Mutual Authentication for Humans (MAH)
======================================

You receive a phone call from someone who claims to work with you and asks
you about sensitive company information. How can you be sure they are who
they say they are?

This system, Mutual Authentication for Humans (MAH), is designed to help.
It enables you to verify that the person you are communicating with via
unauthenticated communications channels (such as phone) is the person they
claim to be and current employee of your organisation.

The system uses the organization's 2 factor authentication system to
provide the strongest and most practical assurance that someone is a
current employee of that organziation. It allows you to create a short
authentication code for another employee. By default, the authentication
code is a short (e.g. 6) character hex-string, consisting of letters from
a-f and numbers 0-9 and codes have a short lifetime (10 minutes).

The system performs a one way authentication via a authentication code, as illustrated in the following example:

1. Bob and Mary are based at different locations and are both members of a large project team.
2. The project is confidential and they are under strict instructions not to discuss any details with anyone external to the project team.
3. Bob calls Mary to ask some questions about the work Mary is doing on the project.
4. Mary doesn't usually speak to Bob on the phone and doesn't recognise his voice.
5. Mary logs in to the verification system using her username and her LinOTP PIN + token code.
6. Mary searches for Bob and generates an authentication code for him.
7. Mary says "Bob, before I discuss this information over the phone, I'd like to verify your identity, so I have authenticated you. Can you please read back the authentication code for me?"
8. Bob also logs into the verification system and sees the authentication from Mary and reads back the authentication code for Mary.

At this point, Mary has authenticated Bob, but Bob has not authenticated
Mary. To authenticate Mary, Bob needs to create a new and different code that
Mary will need to read back to him.

Installation
============
MAH can be installed via packages or manually from source.

Installation Requirements
-------------------------
The Mutual Authentication for Humans (MAH) requires numerous supporting
software packages and services.

* The Python interpreter 'python' - installed by default. (MAH has been tested with both Python versions 2.6 and 2.7)

* A web server (e.g. Apache using WSGI)

* A database (e.g. MySQL)

* The `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ micro-framework, which in turn relies on `Werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_ and `Jinja 2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ (*Important:* Jinja2 version must be 2.6 or higher).

* The `SQL Alchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ SQL tool kit and Object Relational Mapper.

* SeaSurf, a CSRF protection wrapper for Flask.

* The Python Radius API, pyrad and Radius server which is configured to allow the system running MAH to be a NAS (Network Access Server).

* The Python LDAP API, ldap and (read-only) access to an LDAP directory.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Manual Installation
```````````````````

Pre-requisite package installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Apache and MySQL (if needed) and allow connectivity to port 80/443.
::

    # wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm -P /rootwget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
    # sudo rpm -ivh mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpmsudo rpm -ivh mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
    # yum install httpd mod_wsgi mysql-server MySQL-python

2. Install Flask, SQL Alchemy, pyrad, and ldap (and dependencies). Additional python packages will be installed by pip
::

    # yum install python-pip python-sqlalchemy

3. Install packages (not available as an rpm) via pip
::

    # pip install pyrad flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-seasurf six pip3

Download and setup MAH
``````````````````````

4. Download and extract the source tree from the git repository.
::

  # wget https://<source>.tar.gz
  # tar xzf <name>.tar.gz
  # cd mah-*

5. Copy the mah code into the webserver directory.
::

    # mkdir /var/www/wsgi/
    # cp -r {mah,mah.wsgi} /var/www/wsgi


Configuring the web server
``````````````````````````
6. Install apache config
::

    # cp mah.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/

7. Add the following line to /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf to prevent SElinux
alerts, if required.
::

    WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi

Setting up MySQL
````````````````
8. Running the following MySQL commands as root (or similar DBA account)
will set up the required tables.
::

    mysql> create database authdb;
    mysql> create user 'auth'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
    mysql> grant all on authdb.* to 'auth'@'localhost';
    mysql> flush privileges;

   #useful commands: systemctl start mysqld.service; mysql_secure_installation; select * from authentication;

and this dictates the following configuration:
::

    [database]
    connect = mysql://auth:password1@localhost/authdb


SELinux configuration
`````````````````````
The folloing SE Linux policy modules are required for the application to
initiate LDAP and SMTP connections.
::

    module httpd_wsgi_socket 1.0;

    require {
        type httpd_log_t;
        type httpd_t;
        class sock_file create;
    }

    #============= httpd_t ==============
    allow httpd_t httpd_log_t:sock_file create;

    module httpd_ldap_connect 1.0;

    require {
        type ldap_port_t;
        type httpd_t;
        class tcp_socket name_connect;

    }

    #============= httpd_t ==============
    allow httpd_t ldap_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;

    module httpd_smtp_connect 1.0;

    require {
        type httpd_t;
        type smtp_port_t;
        class tcp_socket name_connect;
    }
    allow httpd_t smtp_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;


Further configuration
`````````````````````
Additional configuration of the applciation is recommended, particular the
use of HTTPS, before Radius authentication is enabled.

For a complete list of configuration options, please see the
:doc:`configuration` page.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Apache errors will be report, by default, in /var/log/http/error_log.
Application errors will be reported in the MAH log file or via syslog (see
:doc:`configuration` page for details on the logging options).

Running the application manually may provide additional debugging
information:
::

    /var/www/wsgi/mah/mah.py

This, by default, will start the application using the builtin Werkzeug
http server, on localhost and port 5000 by default (editable in mah.conf)

Configuration
=============
The configuration for MAH is handled via the standard Python `ConfigParser <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_ framework, which uses the Microsoft INI file structure.


location
--------
The location of the configuration file can be specified via the environment
variable MAHCONFIG.

Example (for Bourne compatible shells):
::

    export MAHCONFIG=/path/to/config/mah.conf

Building the docs
=================

The included `Makefile` includes steps for building the docs. From the repositor root, run `make docs`
 to build the documentation. Note that this will invoke a build of the application, so you will need
 all the dependencies installed (see 'Pre-requisite package installation' above).

To avoid installing dependencies locally, you can also use the included `build.Dockerfile` which will 
prepare a minimal build environment.

::

    docker build -f build.Dockerfile -t mah-build .
    docker run -v $PWD:/app mah-build htmldocs
